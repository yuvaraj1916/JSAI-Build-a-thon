## üìù Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have done the previous quest, ensure you pull your changes from GitHub using `git pull` before continuing with this project to update the project README.

Throughout all quests in this project, you have been following a minimalistic approach to building functional AI applications. However, in today's fast-paced world of technology, building robust production-ready AI solutions demands the use of the right tools and frameworks, and adoption of industry best practices.

This can be a daunting task, often requiring:-
- Too many decisions to make
- Difficulty in identifying and implementing shifting industry best practices
- Need for repeatable and scalable solutions
- Familiarity with the latest tools, services, and frameworks

To address these challenges, this quest introduces you azd-templates, a collection of production-ready templates that can be used to quickly build and deploy AI applications. These templates are designed to be easy to use and customizable, allowing you to focus on building your application rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## üß∞ Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The Azure Developer CLI (azd) is an open-source, developer-centric command-line (CLI) tool, part of a wider ecosystem to help you accelerate the provisioning and deployment of applications to Azure. Long gone are the many arguments and flags typically used, azd uses intuitive, developer-friendly commands that represent key development stages, boosting your overall productivity.

| azd command | Objective |
|-------------|-------------|
| `azd auth`  | Authenticate with Azure |
| `azd init`  | Initializes a new project |
| `azd package`  | Packages the application's code to be deployed to Azure. |
| `azd provision`  | Provision the Azure resources for an application. |
| `azd deploy`  | Deploy the application's code to Azure. |
| `azd up`    | Provisions and deploys the application |
| `azd down`  | Deletes the Azure resources for an application.

## üìö azd Templates

azd templates are a collection of application code (samples) and azd configuration files that can be used to quickly customize and deploy production-ready applications to Azure. 

Each template includes:-
- **Proof-of-concept (PoC) starter code** to help you kickstart your project without starting from scratch. These templates go beyond ‚Äòhello-world‚Äô examples, demonstrating how to build complex systems, allowing you to customize the code, or completely replace with your own,
- Everything you need to get a **Fully managed end-to-end system/ application** running on Azure, with configuration files to handle one-click deployments,
- **Reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) assets** to provision and maintain cloud services

With azd templates, you can: -
- Focus on writing the best code and deployment infrastructure for your application all in one context
- Quickly create prototypes and proof-of-concept applications, accelerating innovation
- Learn industry best practices and patterns for building production-ready AI applications

## ‚úÖ Activity: Browse through JS/TS AI Templates

The key to identifying the right template for your project is to understand the requirements of your application. The templates are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

Then:-
1. Visit the [AI app template](https://azure.github.io/ai-app-templates/?tags=javascript&tags=typescript) gallery to browse through the available templates.
