## 📋 Pre-requisites

1. A GitHub account
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed
4. An Azure subscription. Use the [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) if you don't have one, or [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) if you are a student.
5. [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows) installed

## 📝 Overview

In this step, you will learn you can simplify integrating AI features into your web applications using frameworks. [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for working with different LLMs, tools, and data sources, making it easier to build complex applications.

### Assumption ⚠️

This step assumes you have already completed the previous steps in this project and have a working web application that uses Azure's LLM endpoints. If you haven't done so, please click the **Reset Progress** button above to select the _Add a simple chat interface_ quest.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have done the previous quest, ensure you pull your changes from GitHub using `git pull` before continuing with this project to update the project README.

## Step 1️⃣: Add LangChain.js to your project
We'll first install LangChain.js in our project to ensure our backend can communicate with Azure's LLM endpoints using LangChain's abstractions.

In your webapi directory, run

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/openai
```
The current api code uses the Azure REST SDK directly. By switching to LangChain.js, we will decouple to code to take advantage of its abstractions and features like chains (composing tools and LLMs) and memory (storing conversation history).

### Update imports

Open `server.js` and replace:

```javascript
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";
import { isUnexpected } from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
``` 

with:

```javascript
import { AzureChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
```

### Update client initialization
Initialize LangChain's `AzureChatOpenAI` model client by replacing:

```javascript
const client = ModelClient(
  process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_SDK_ENDPOINT,
  new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_SDK_KEY)
);
```

with:

```javascript
const chatModel = new AzureChatOpenAI({
  azureOpenAIApiKey: process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_SDK_KEY,
  azureOpenAIApiInstanceName: process.env.INSTANCE_NAME, // In target url: https://<INSTANCE_NAME>.services...
  azureOpenAIApiDeploymentName: process.env.DEPLOYMENT_NAME, // i.e "gpt-4o"
  azureOpenAIApiVersion: "2024-08-01-preview", // In target url: ...<VERSION>
  temperature: 1,
  maxTokens: 4096,
});
```

> [!Note]
> Update your `.env` with the missing variables 

### Update chat endpoint

Replace the Azure REST SDK api call logic in the try-catch block (_app.post("/chat")_) with the following code:

```javascript
  try {
    const response = await chatModel.invoke(messages);
    res.json({ reply: response.content });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Model call failed",
      message: err.message,
      reply: "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again."
    });
  }
```

### Test the integration

Restart the server to confirm the changes are working. 

## Step 2️⃣: Add conversation memory

Currently, the chat model does not remember previous messages. For example, if you send a message like _"Hey, you can call me Terry. What should I call you?"_

Then ask the model _"Quiz time. What's my name?"_. The model will not remember your name because your name is not passed to the model in the prompt.

![Memory test](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/JS-AI-Build-a-thon/blob/assets/jsai-buildathon-assets/memory-test.png?raw=true)

To add memory, you will use LangChain's built-in memory modules - `ChatMessageHistory` and `ConversationSummaryMemory`. Conversation memory allows the AI to reference previous exchanges in a session, enabling more context-aware and coherent responses and LangChain.js provides built-in memory modules that make this easy to implement. With LangChain, you can implement stateful AI app experiences without manually managing chat logs, and you can easily switch between in-memory, Redis, or other storage options.


### How it would work in your app

- Each user session (or conversation) maintains a history of messages.
- When a user sends a new message, the backend includes previous exchanges from that session in the prompt.
- The AI can reference earlier questions and answers, making the chat feel more natural and intelligent.

### Update imports

Add the following imports to the top of your `server.js` file:

```javascript
import { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";
import { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/stores/message/in_memory";
```

### Set up session-based in-memory store

Store session histories, allowing you to maintain separate chat histories for different users or sessions.

```javascript
const sessionMemories = {};
```

### Add a helper function to get/create a session history

This utility function will check if a session history already exists for a given session ID. If it doesn't, it will create a new one.

```javascript
function getSessionMemory(sessionId) {
  if (!sessionMemories[sessionId]) {
    const history = new ChatMessageHistory();
    sessionMemories[sessionId] = new BufferMemory({
      chatHistory: history,
      returnMessages: true,
      memoryKey: "chat_history",
    });
  }
  return sessionMemories[sessionId];
}
```

### Update the chat endpoint

Lastly, you'll update the /chat handler to fetch session memory and load the chat history. Before sending the prompt to the model, the chat history will be added to the messages array so that the AI has context when generating the next reply. You then save the latest user message and model response to the session memory.

```javascript
app.post("/chat", async (req, res) => {
  const userMessage = req.body.message;
  const useRAG = req.body.useRAG === undefined ? true : req.body.useRAG;
  const sessionId = req.body.sessionId || "default";

  let sources = [];

  const memory = getSessionMemory(sessionId);
  const memoryVars = await memory.loadMemoryVariables({});

  if (useRAG) {
    await loadPDF();
    sources = retrieveRelevantContent(userMessage);
  }

  // Prepare system prompt
  const systemMessage = useRAG
    ? {
        role: "system",
        content: sources.length > 0
          ? `You are a helpful assistant for Contoso Electronics. You must ONLY use the information provided below to answer.\n\n--- EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK EXCERPTS ---\n${sources.join('\n\n')}\n--- END OF EXCERPTS ---`
          : `You are a helpful assistant for Contoso Electronics. The excerpts do not contain relevant information for this question. Reply politely: \"I'm sorry, I don't know. The employee handbook does not contain information about that.\"`,
      }
    : {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful and knowledgeable assistant. Answer the user's questions concisely and informatively.",
      };

  try {
    // Build final messages array
    const messages = [
      systemMessage,
      ...(memoryVars.chat_history || []),
      { role: "user", content: userMessage },
    ];

    const response = await chatModel.invoke(messages);

    await memory.saveContext({ input: userMessage }, { output: response.content });

    res.json({ reply: response.content, sources });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Model call failed",
      message: err.message,
      reply: "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again."
    });
  }
});
```

To test this, open the chat UI in your browser and send a message like _"Hey, you can call me Terry. What should I call you?"_ and then ask _"Quiz time. What's my name?"_. The model should remember your name.
